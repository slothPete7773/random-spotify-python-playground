 # Roughly developmental steps

 1. DONE: Do auth(things)
    - authen -> authorize

 2. DONE: Function calling to Spotify API service
 3. TODO: Manage to fetch data
 4. TODO: Transform the data and save to file
 5. TODO: Store the data, maybe on cloud
 6. TODO: Automate the flow, maybe Airflow
 7. PLAN: Think about what to analyse, compare, and visualize from the historical top tracks/artists data.
